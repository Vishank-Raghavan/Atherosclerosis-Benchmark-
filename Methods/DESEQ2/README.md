# Transcriptomic Analysis with DESeq2

This directory contains the R script used to benchmark the **DESeq2** method for identifying transcriptomic targets in atherosclerosis. DESeq2 estimates variance-mean dependence in count data from high-throughput sequencing assays and tests for differential expression based on a model using the negative binomial distribution.

## Overview

The script performs differential expression analysis on raw RNA-seq counts to identify genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated in atherosclerotic plaques compared to healthy tissue.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Data Loading:** Imports the raw gene count matrix (integer counts) generated by Salmon.

2. **Metadata Parsing:** Loads the SRA Run Table and cleans the `treatment` column to define biological groups ("Atheroma" vs. "Healthy"), filtering out irrelevant samples (e.g., time-course treatments).

3. **Data Object Construction:** Creates a `DESeqDataSet` from the count matrix and metadata.

4. **Filtering:** Removes low-abundance genes to improve statistical power and reduce multiple testing burden.

5. **Analysis:** Runs the standard `DESeq()` function, which performs size factor estimation, dispersion estimation, and negative binomial GLM fitting.

6. **Extraction:** Extracts results for the contrast `Atheroma - Healthy` and filters for significant targets (FDR < 0.05).

## Files

* **`DESEQ2_Analysis.R`**: The main R script for data loading, metadata cleaning, and differential expression analysis.

## Input Requirements

This script requires the following files to be present in the working directory:

* `rna_seq_counts_matrix.csv`: A matrix where rows are Transcript/Gene IDs and columns are Sample IDs (SRR...). Values must be raw integer counts.
* `SraRunTable.csv`: SRA metadata file containing the `treatment` column used to define groups.

## Usage

Run the script using R or RStudio.

**Command Line:**

```bash
Rscript DESEQ2_Analysis.R
```

### Dependencies
* DESEQ2 (Bioconductor)
* tidyverse

  ## Output
  `deseq2_significant_genes.csv`: A CSV file containing the list of transcripts identified as significantly differentially expressed (FDR < 0.05), including log2FoldChange and adjusted P-values.
